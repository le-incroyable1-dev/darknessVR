darknessVR is a VR application that helps people with phobia of darkness to overcome their fears. 
The app provides a small therapy session. It is based in a low poly, dark forest environment which 
provides a safe space for people to confront the fear. The user is supposed to navigate the dark
environment, light firewood for clarity and enter a mansion to finally end the session. 

Developed using Unity3D and the Google Cardboard SDK.
